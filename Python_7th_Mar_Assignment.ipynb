    "The mean, median, and mode are three different measures of central tendency used to describe the center of a dataset. The main differences between them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of data. It is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is affected by extreme values, or outliers, and is generally used to describe datasets with a symmetrical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value of a set of data when the values are arranged in order of magnitude. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by extreme values and is generally used to describe datasets with a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. A dataset can have multiple modes, or no mode at all if all values occur with the same frequency. The mode is not affected by extreme values and is generally used to describe datasets with a categorical or nominal variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures are used to measure the central tendency of a dataset because they provide information about where the center of the data is located. For example, if the mean, median, and mode are all close in value, it suggests that the data is clustered around a central value. If the mean is much larger or smaller than the median or mode, it suggests that the data is skewed in one direction or the other. The choice of measure to use depends on the type of data and the research question being addressed."

    "\n",
    "2. Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It is calculated by summing the squared deviations of each value from the mean and dividing by the number of values. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower variance indicates that the data is clustered closer to the mean.\n",

    "3. Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a commonly used measure of dispersion and is more interpretable than the variance, as it is expressed in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the data is clustered closer to the mean.\n",

These measures suggest that the scores are clustered around the mean of 85, but with some variability between values. The range indicates that the scores are spread out over a range of 20 points, while the variance and standard deviation indicate that the data is relatively tightly clustered around the mean."
